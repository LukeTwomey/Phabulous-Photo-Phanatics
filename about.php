                            <p>Phabulous Photo Phanatics was established in 1990, by Peter Wirecroft. Then a lone photographer, he has since built the company into what it is today, consisting of over two hundred professional photographers country-wide.</p>
                            <p>Initially working solely as a wedding photographer, Peter joined forces with renowned portrait expert John Sitstill in 1994, and together they rapidly grew the business, without losing sight of the quality of work that the company is known for.</p>
